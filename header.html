  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is <em> Kevin Ruiz </em> and I am currently enrolled in Queens College as a Media Studies major.<br>

    I am hoping to earn my degree and pursue a carrer in Film Production. At the moment I currently do freelancing photography and
    videos. I've made this website as a portfolio to showcase my greatest works and gain exposure to my art.<br>

  <p> Because I am currently a student, I am available to collaberate and work for commission on projects and jobs. I am free to contact
    via email. Please leave a message with your contact info and breif summary of your request.<br>
    Thank you for visiting.</p>
